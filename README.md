# equations-solver

This is the code used to solve the `EQUATIONS_SOLVER CHALLENGE` from [CodeFights](https://codefights.com).

## Instructions

You're given a string containing a simple linear equation. Your task is to find the value of `x`.
The equation contains only operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `=`, `x` (only once) and digits. It is guaranteed that all sub-results are integers.

**Examples:**

- `equations_solver("2x+4=20") = 8`
- `equations_solver("5*2+x*2=40") = 15`

- **[input] string e**

    - The string that contains the expression.


- **[output] integer**

    - The value of x.
